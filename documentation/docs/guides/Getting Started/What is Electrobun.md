Electrobun aims to be a batteries included framework for building desktop apps with Typescript.

## Priorities

What makes electrobun different, aside from our approach to achitecture are our project goals:

### Batteries included

- Write typescript without wasting time on devops
- Everything needed to build, test, codesign, update

### Iteration speed

- Building your app as fast as possible so you can iterate on features and fixes as fast as possible
- Enabling you to ship small, cost effective updates (as small as 14KB) so you can ship new features and fixes to your end users and get feedback as fast and often as possible

### Affordable to maintain

- MIT open source
- Ship updates to your users that are tiny
- All you need is a file server (eg: S3) to distribute your app

### Flexible

- Use any modern framework for UI (from plain HTML, to Preact, SolidJS, and more)
- Use the built-in system Webview (or bundle a 3rd party webview like Chromium: _coming soon..._)

### Security and Performance

- Bun and Zig under the hood
- The main process and browser processes are isolated from each other
- Opt-in to enable fast, typed, and easy to extend RPC between main and browser processes
- A custom webview tag implementation for OOPIFs so you can build a web browser
