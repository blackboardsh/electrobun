## Introduction

Configure your Applications icons. These icons are used for the icon of your app in the app switcher and in the file system like on your Desktop or in the Applications folder.

### MacOS

The default location for the icon folder is in the root of your repo in a folder named `icon.iconset`. At minimum you should add a 1024x1024 png icon, but you can add other sizes as well for more control. [Read here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-your-app-icon) for more details.

You can specify a custom path for the `icon.iconset` folder in your [electrobun.config](/docs/apis/cli/Build Configration) file.
